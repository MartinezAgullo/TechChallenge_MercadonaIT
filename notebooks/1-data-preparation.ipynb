    "### üìÑ Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the evaluation phase of your application for the Data Science position. This notebook is designed to assess your skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and forecasting. You will be provided with a dataset and a series of tasks aimed at testing your ability to interpret data and extract meaningful insights that could inform future forecasting models.\n",

    "### üéØ Objective\n",
    "Your main objective in this notebook is to conduct a thorough exploratory analysis of the provided dataset. You should aim to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data. The insights you generate here will be pivotal for building robust forecasting models in later stages.\n",
